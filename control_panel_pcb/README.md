# Control Panel Circuit Board Pictures

Canon Pixma MX340 control panel is a single-layer circuit board.
It spanned most of the width of the machine and hosted all of its user
interface controls: buttons, LED lights, and a LCD screen.

In order to follow traces as they travel from one end of the board to
the other, I took close-up pictures of the board in sections and
stitched them together manually.

## Result

I did not use panorama stitching software because their goal is to generate
a pretty picture. Usually involving warping, blending, or otherwise
transforming the pictures so they look good together.

For this project I needed clarity and accuracy, it didn't matter if the
color balance is different between frames making edges noticeable. It didn't
matter if, due to how I moved my camera, the result is slightly trapezoidal.
The functionally important criteria is that all the circuitry traces have
been preserved unaltered and aligned across images.

After I was satisfied with my stitch, I adjusted the contrast range to make
copper circuitry more visible. Unfortunately this meant lighter features are
overblown and darker detail crushed. That's fine... it doesn't need to look
good, it just needs to be accurate!
